# XYZ Molecular Structures - Compressed

This directory contains molecular structure files in XYZ format for all compounds and conformers analyzed in the quorum sensing inhibitor project.

## Directory Structure

The compressed XYZ directory is organized into the following subdirectories:

```
xyz/
├── CREST/
│   ├── CREST_clusters_postDFT/
│   ├── CREST_clusters_xTB/
│   └── CREST_rotamers_xTB/
├── Conformer Families/
│   ├── conformer_0/ through conformer_8/
```

## CREST Structures

The `CREST/` directory contains the structures generated by the Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST) at different stages of the computational workflow:

### CREST_clusters_postDFT/

Contains the nine primary conformer structures after density functional theory (DFT) optimization:
- `structure_00.xyz` through `structure_08.xyz`
- These represent the highest-level quantum mechanical refined structures

### CREST_clusters_xTB/

Contains the nine primary conformer structures from extended tight-binding (xTB) calculations before DFT refinement:
- `structure_00.xyz` through `structure_08.xyz`
- These represent the intermediate-level quantum mechanical structures

### CREST_rotamers_xTB/

Contains all 56 rotamer structures identified by CREST at the xTB level:
- `structure_00.xyz` through `structure_55.xyz`
- These represent the complete conformational space explored before clustering

## Conformer Families

The `Conformer Families/` directory organizes compounds by conformer type, with separate subdirectories for each of the nine conformers. Each conformer directory contains:

- `average_structure.xyz`: The template structure representing the conformer
- XYZ files for all compounds in that conformational family:
  - Base compound: `basic.xyz`
  - Substituted derivatives named according to substitution pattern (e.g., `p_Cl.xyz`, `m_OMe.xyz`)
  - Special compounds (e.g., `penta_F.xyz`, `o_Naph.xyz`)

Each conformer family contains the same set of compounds, but with the molecular geometry optimized according to that specific conformational starting structure.

## Nomenclature

The file naming convention for substituted compounds follows this pattern:
- Position prefix: `p_X` (4-X), `m_` (3- or 5-X), `o_` (2- or 6-X), `mm_` (3,5-X), etc.
- Substituent: `Cl`, `F`, `Br`, `I`, `Me`, `OMe`, `CN`, etc.

Example: `mp_Cl.xyz` represents the 3,4-Cl substituted derivative.
